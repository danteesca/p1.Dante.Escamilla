### C:

There are two main issues that I see with the interface on this elevator. First is the use of letters, especially those that are non-standard in this country. While the letter G is normally denoted to mean “ground” as in the main entrance level at ground level, I think this notation of it is misleading especially in a context such as this one since the “ground” level is lower than the ground level outside the building. The use of the letter V in this interface is not a standardized symbol so unlike “ground” being denoted as G, a person with no prior knowledge of this building will not know where they are going when they press that button. When they do press this button they will find the doors open to a small room that only leads to an exit of the building. To fix this, I would convert the “V” button to “G” and convert the “G” button to “B”, meaning basement. Additionally, this interface suffers from the same problem that many elevators do, which is the use of two almost identical symbols to open and close different doors. While this is not a problem in elevators with just one door, those with two could use a better design of these symbols to indicate their function and to differentiate between the sets of doors. This problem of having multiple open door buttons is almost unnecessary as oftentimes, elevators with multiple doors only have one set of doors open at one time and when they do open both doors at once, having one open door button is sufficient. In the case of this elevator, the rear set of doors only open when the “V” button is pressed and the user exits the building. In any case, only one set of doors can open at a time on any given level so having a separate button for the rear set of doors is not needed. Lastly, the phone button is separated from the rest of the buttons. It should be placed next to them while the “Run Stop” keyhole should be placed lower since its function and use differs from the buttons around it.

### B:

The common uses of the interface on this elevator are fairly straightforward to use; however, the same can not be said for the open and close door buttons which I believe is going to be the next most used set of buttons after the ones for the various floors. The more rare functions are also done fairly well because of their use of standardized symbols outside of the scope of just elevators that make sense for their purpose such as the bell for the alarm button and the phone for the phone system in the elevator. These buttons should only be used in the event of an emergency so their use should be quite rare but the symbols used to denote them are standardized across various phone and computer systems so they are easy to figure out. The alarm button takes this a step further however and is labeled underneath with “Push for Alarm” which will also help guide someone in a stressful situation. 

A normal sequence of actions for a user of the elevator starts on the exterior panel. They will first indicate to the elevator if they need to go up or down by pressing one of the exterior buttons, the higher one to go up and the lower one to go down. When the elevator arrives at their floor they will indicate which floor they would like to stop at with the interior panel and maybe even press the close door button. They will then wait while the elevator moves to the floor they indicated and then exit the car. 

The elevator supports the user in figuring out how to use it by placing the buttons for the various floors sequentially upwards, meaning the lower floors are lower on the panel and the higher floors move upwards from the starting point. These buttons are also labeled to indicate which floor they will take you to. The elevator interface tries to do something similar by using standard symbols for the close door functions but as discussed previously, it does not do this well. 

With this elevator there are multiple types of feedback as there normally is for any elevator. First, the buttons have lights around them to indicate when a button has been pressed. This confirms to the user that their button press has been registered and the elevator will move to that floor. There is also audio feedback to indicate when a new floor has been reached as well as when the doors are opening at the specified floor. For the exterior panel, there is similar feedback with a light around the buttons and an audio queue to indicate the elevator is arriving. There is also a display above the elevator doorway to indicate which floor the car is currently on. While some elevators have arrows to indicate the direction the car is moving, this one does not.  

The most common errors that I can foresee happening with this elevator is the use of the V button of the interior panel when the user does not know where it will go, as well as the misuse of the open and close door buttons. This is only an issue because there are two sets of doors and the symbols for the different doors are too similar to each other though, even when only one set is used on a single door car, these symbol designs still fail to properly indicate what they mean what they mean because they only display the intended action. They would be much better if they displayed the intended action and the result of said action. 

To improve on the design, I would do away with the use of letters and simply have buttons G, B, and 1-3 as well as change the symbols of the open door buttons to either more plain, non-triangular arrows or perhaps display a symbol that better indicates the end goal of the action. Of course this isn't necessary as they could both be labeled “door open” and “door close” underneath the button in much the same way the alarm button is labeled; however, this option may still not be ideal for people that do not speak english or those that have dyslexia, so it would be better overall to improve upon the symbols being used.
